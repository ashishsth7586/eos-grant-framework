  6. Documentation: A comprehensive documentation section that provides information about the zkEVM project, its features, and its technical specifications. This could include tutorials, guides, and API references for developers.

- Data models of the core functionality

  The core functionality of the zkEVM circuit is based on two data models:

  1. Proof Generation: The proof generation function, C^, is defined as pz(a) = C^(a, H, θ, L, ∆(θ :: V t(L)), κz), where a is the address, H is the block header, θ is the anchor transaction, L is the block’s RLP-encoded txList, ∆ is the EVM trace logs generated from running θ and all transactions in L, and κz is ZK-EVM’s proving key.
  2. Proof Verification: The proof verification function, V^, is defined as V^(pz, a, h[i], KEC(L), κv), where pz is the validity proof generated by address a, h[i] is the block’s block hash, KEC(L) is the block intrinsic validity test, and κv is ZK-EVM’s verification key.

- API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used

  1. Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM): The EVM is used to execute smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
  2. ZK-Proofs: The zkEVM circuit uses zero-knowledge proofs to prove the validity of computations in sub-linear time.
  3. Block Header: The block header is used to store important information about a block, such as its block number and the hash of the previous block.
  4. Anchor Transaction: The anchor transaction is used as the starting point for generating the EVM trace logs.
  5. RLP Encoding: The txList is encoded using Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoding, which is a compact binary format used in Ethereum.
  6. EVM Trace Logs: The EVM trace logs are generated from running the anchor transaction and all transactions in the txList.
  7. Contextual Validity Function: The Contextual Validity function is used to determine if a transaction is valid or not.
  8. Proving Key: The proving key is used to generate the validity proof.
  9. Verification Key: The verification key is used to verify the validity proof.

  The zkEVM circuit, which is the subsystem that allows the zkprotocol to prove an Ethereum-equivalent chain in sub-linear time. The proof generation function is defined as pz(a) = C^(a, H, θ, L, ∆(θ :: Vt(L)), κz) where H is the block header, θ is the anchor transaction, L is the block's RLP-encoded txList, ∆ is the EVM trace logs generated from running θ and all transactions in L, and κz is ZK-EVM's proving key. The proof verification function is defined as V^(pz, a, h[i], KEC(L), κv) where h[i] is the block's block hash, and κv is ZK-EVM's verification key.

- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - I would like to clarify that our project, the zkEVM circuits, is a core subsystem that enables the zkprotocol to prove an Ethereum-equivalent chain in sub-linear time. It is designed to be a scalability solution for Ethereum with the assumption that the cryptography and code used in the implementation is secure. For the full deployment cost is the key limitation, our estimate is we needs $1.3m.
  - While our project is designed to provide a secure and scalable solution for Ethereum, it may have limitations and limitations that are not immediately obvious. For example, the ZK-EVM disables certain Ethereum upgrades, and it is unable to generate a proof if the txList fails to pass the Block Intrinsic Validity test or any transaction fails to pass the transaction Contextual Validity test. Additionally, our project is not a comprehensive solution for all Ethereum scalability issues, and it may not be suitable for all use cases.
  - It is important to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that may not be immediately obvious. This will help ensure that our project is used appropriately and that our users have a clear understanding of what our project can and cannot do.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

  - Our project fits into the EOS ecosystem as a solution that addresses the limitations of current blockchain platforms, such as scalability and security. With our zkEVM technology, we aim to provide a platform that allows for high throughput and low composability needs, making it a suitable platform for DeFi protocols, NFTs, gaming, and authentication. The ability to port existing Ethereum contracts seamlessly to our platform and the quick withdrawal times for NFTs sets us apart from current solutions. At Zebec zkEOS, we are dedicated to improving the user experience and providing a platform that is secure, efficient and flexible for developers. Our team is passionate about pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the blockchain space and we believe that our project will play a significant role in the future of blockchain technology.

- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
  - Our target audience is diverse and includes chain developers, dApp developers, wallet developers, UI/UX designers, and the wider blockchain community. We aim to provide a seamless and efficient platform for these developers and designers to build their projects on, while also catering to the needs of end-users who are looking for faster, more secure and scalable solutions within the EOS ecosystem.

## Development Roadmap

**Core EOSIO Chain / Sub-modules**

**Applies to**

- Building/extending the core EOSIO code base or sub-modules.

**Requirements**

- List the publicly exposed methods: The methods allow developers to interact with the EVM Contract and perform tasks such as sending and receiving transactions, accessing network information, and integrating with other EVM-based applications or services. By providing publicly exposed methods, the Ethereum EVM) enables developers to build and extend the EVM in innovative ways, creating new applications, services, and features that enhance the overall user experience and value of the network. These methods also play a crucial role in fostering the growth and development of the EVM ecosystem by allowing developers to easily integrate with and build on top of the EVM.
- For each method, specify (to the best of present knowledge):???
  Method signature :In EOS, transactions are signed to prove ownership of the account and its associated resources, such as tokens and bandwidth. The signature also ensures that the transaction cannot be modified or tampered with after it has been broadcasted to the network.

The process of generating a transaction signature involves several steps:

1. **Hashing**: The transaction is hashed to create a unique identifier that represents the contents of the transaction.
2. **Signing**: The hashed transaction is then signed using the private key associated with the account that is initiating the transaction. The signature is created using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).
3. **Broadcasting**: The signed transaction is broadcasted to the network, where it is validated and added to a block.

Once the transaction has been signed and broadcasted, the signature can be used to verify that the transaction was created by the owner of the account, and that the contents of the transaction have not been altered.

In summary, the transaction signature is an essential component of transactions in EOS, providing security and accountability to the network.

For zkEOS we will use SNARK based signature. In a SNARK-based transaction, the signer proves the ownership of the assets being transferred without revealing any additional information about the assets or the transaction. This is achieved through the use of a zk-SNARK proof, which consists of a pair of mathematical algorithms that can be used to demonstrate the validity of the transaction without revealing any information about it.

SNARK-based transaction signatures provide enhanced privacy and security for blockchain transactions, as they allow users to prove the authenticity of their transactions without revealing any sensitive information. This can help to prevent fraud and ensure the privacy of users on the network.

In summary, SNARK-based transaction signatures are a type of zero-knowledge transaction signature that use zk-SNARKs to provide privacy and security for blockchain transactions.

Short description (code template):

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

contract SnarkSignature {
  struct Input {
  uint256 value;
  bytes32 assetId;
}

struct Output {
  address recipient;
  uint256 value;
  bytes32 assetId;
}

function transfer(Input[] calldata inputs, Output[] calldata outputs) public {
require(inputs.length == outputs.length, "Invalid number of inputs and outputs");

    // Verify the zk-SNARK proof
    require(verifyProof(inputs, outputs), "Invalid zk-SNARK proof");

    // Transfer the assets to the specified recipients
    for (uint i = 0; i < outputs.length; i++) {
      outputs[i].recipient.transfer(outputs[i].value);
    }

}

function verifyProof(Input[] calldata inputs, Output[] calldata outputs) public view returns (bool) {
  // Verify the zk-SNARK proof using the trusted setup
  // ...

  return true;
}
```

- Runtime Storage defined by our module: zkEOS’s underlying architecture and provides the means for applications and services to persist and access data within the zkEOS network. The runtime storage is designed to be highly efficient and scalable, allowing for large amounts of data to be stored and processed quickly and efficiently. The specific design and implementation of the runtime storage may vary between zkEOS modules, but the main goal is to provide a reliable and secure storage solution that supports the diverse needs of applications and services running on the zkEOS.
- Use case diagram with e.g. UML or SysML (or similar tool demonstrating how external users/system components interact with one another):

To get started with using Git for ZKEVM, simply download the relevant package for our operating system from the official Git website and proceed with its installation on our system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 2.  | Deploy CMAKE                        | To configure the build process for ZKEVM, we will be utilizing CMake, an open-source, cross-platform build system. To get started, simply download the appropriate package for our operating system from the official CMake website and install it on our system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3.  | Deploy a C++ compiler               | To build ZKEVM, which is written in C++, we will need a C++ compiler. There are popular options available such as GCC and Clang. We can acquire a C++ compiler by utilizing the package manager for our operating system or by downloading the suitable package from the official website of the desired compiler.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 4.  | Install any additional dependencies | ZKEVM may require additional dependencies to be installed, such as Boost, libsecp256k1, and libsodium. We will need to sure to install these dependencies and configure them properly before attempting to build ZKEVM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 3.  | Create a build directory:                 | Create a new directory in the ZKEVM repository where the build artifacts will be stored. For example: <ul><li>mkdir build</li><li>cd build</li><li>Run CMake: Run CMake to configure the build process for ZKEVM. Pass the path to the ZKEVM source code directory as an argument to CMake.</li><li>Configure CMake options: If we want to specify any additional options for the build process, wecan use the "-D" option when running CMake. For example, we can specify the location of the Boost libraries with the following option: cmake .. -DBOOST_ROOT=/usr/local/boost</li><li>Generate the Makefile: Once CMake has finished configuring the build process, it will generate a Makefile. This Makefile can be used to compile the code for EOS.</li><li>Verify the configuration: we can check the configuration settings generated by CMake by looking at the output of the CMake command or by examining the generated Makefile. Make sure that the configuration is correct and all necessary dependencies are properly linked.</li><li>Save the configuration: If the configuration is correct, save the CMake configuration so that we do not have to run CMake again in the future. This will allow we to simply run make to compile the code for EOS.</li></ul> |
