## Project Overview

### Overview

- **Name:** zkEOS is a high throughput zkEVM solution built on top of EOS
- **Brief Description:** ZkEOS is a blockchain solution that provides high throughput and security features for various use cases including DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and authentication, allowing for a seamless experience with low transaction costs and fast withdrawals while preserving privacy and user trust.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** The potential relationship between zkEOS and EOSIO could be seen as zkEOS being a layer built on top of the EOSIO protocol to offer additional benefits and improved user experience.
- **Reason for Interest:** At Zebec, we are passionate about the potential for blockchain technology to revolutionize the way we transact and interact with each other. As experienced developers and enthusiasts in the blockchain space, we have identified a gap in the current offerings in terms of both security and scalability. That's why we are excited to introduce Zebec zkEOS, a next-generation layer 2 scaling solution that leverages the power of zero-knowledge proofs to bring unprecedented w security and performance to the EOSIO ecosystem. Our team is committed to making Zebec zkEOS the go-to platform for developers and users who want to build and interact with decentralized applications that are fast, secure, and scalable.

### Project Details

- Mock-ups/designs of any UI components

  1. Homepage: A clean and simple homepage that provides an overview of the zkEVM project and its features. This could include a brief explanation of what zkEVM is, its benefits, and how it works.

  2. Dashboard: A dashboard that provides real-time information about the state of the network, such as the number of active transactions, the block height, and the status of transactions.

  3. Wallet: A secure wallet that allows users to store and manage their assets, including Ether and ERC20 tokens. This could include features such as sending and receiving transactions, viewing transaction history, and managing private keys.

  4. Contract Deployment: A user-friendly interface that allows developers to deploy and manage smart contracts on the zkEVM network. This could include features such as compiling and testing contracts, deploying contracts, and interacting with deployed contracts.

  5. Explorer: A blockchain explorer that allows users to view information about the zkEVM network, including the latest blocks, transactions, and smart contracts.

  6. Documentation: A comprehensive documentation section that provides information about the zkEVM project, its features, and its technical specifications. This could include tutorials, guides, and API references for developers.

- Data models of the core functionality

  The core functionality of the zkEVM circuit is based on two data models:

  1. Proof Generation: The proof generation function, C^, is defined as pz(a) = C^(a, H, θ, L, ∆(θ :: V t(L)), κz), where a is the address, H is the block header, θ is the anchor transaction, L is the block’s RLP-encoded txList, ∆ is the EVM trace logs generated from running θ and all transactions in L, and κz is ZK-EVM’s proving key.
  2. Proof Verification: The proof verification function, V^, is defined as V^(pz, a, h[i], KEC(L), κv), where pz is the validity proof generated by address a, h[i] is the block’s block hash, KEC(L) is the block intrinsic validity test, and κv is ZK-EVM’s verification key.

- API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used

  1. Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM): The EVM is used to execute smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
  2. ZK-Proofs: The zkEVM circuit uses zero-knowledge proofs to prove the validity of computations in sub-linear time.
  3. Block Header: The block header is used to store important information about a block, such as its block number and the hash of the previous block.
  4. Anchor Transaction: The anchor transaction is used as the starting point for generating the EVM trace logs.
  5. RLP Encoding: The txList is encoded using Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoding, which is a compact binary format used in Ethereum.
  6. EVM Trace Logs: The EVM trace logs are generated from running the anchor transaction and all transactions in the txList.
  7. Contextual Validity Function: The Contextual Validity function is used to determine if a transaction is valid or not.
  8. Proving Key: The proving key is used to generate the validity proof.
  9. Verification Key: The verification key is used to verify the validity proof.

- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed

  The zkEVM circuit, which is the subsystem that allows the zkprotocol to prove an Ethereum-equivalent chain in sub-linear time. The proof generation function is defined as pz(a) = C^(a, H, θ, L, ∆(θ :: Vt(L)), κz) where H is the block header, θ is the anchor transaction, L is the block's RLP-encoded txList, ∆ is the EVM trace logs generated from running θ and all transactions in L, and κz is ZK-EVM's proving key. The proof verification function is defined as V^(pz, a, h[i], KEC(L), κv) where h[i] is the block's block hash, and κv is ZK-EVM's verification key.

- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - I would like to clarify that our project, the zkEVM circuits, is a core subsystem that enables the zkprotocol to prove an Ethereum-equivalent chain in sub-linear time. It is designed to be a scalability solution for Ethereum with the assumption that the cryptography and code used in the implementation is secure. For the full deployment cost is the key limitation, our estimate is we needs $1.3m.
  - While our project is designed to provide a secure and scalable solution for Ethereum, it may have limitations and limitations that are not immediately obvious. For example, the ZK-EVM disables certain Ethereum upgrades, and it is unable to generate a proof if the txList fails to pass the Block Intrinsic Validity test or any transaction fails to pass the transaction Contextual Validity test. Additionally, our project is not a comprehensive solution for all Ethereum scalability issues, and it may not be suitable for all use cases.
  - It is important to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that may not be immediately obvious. This will help ensure that our project is used appropriately and that our users have a clear understanding of what our project can and cannot do.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

  - Our project fits into the EOS ecosystem as a solution that addresses the limitations of current blockchain platforms, such as scalability and security. With our zkEVM technology, we aim to provide a platform that allows for high throughput and low composability needs, making it a suitable platform for DeFi protocols, NFTs, gaming, and authentication. The ability to port existing Ethereum contracts seamlessly to our platform and the quick withdrawal times for NFTs sets us apart from current solutions. At Zebec zkEOS, we are dedicated to improving the user experience and providing a platform that is secure, efficient and flexible for developers. Our team is passionate about pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the blockchain space and we believe that our project will play a significant role in the future of blockchain technology.

- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
  - Our target audience is diverse and includes chain developers, dApp developers, wallet developers, UI/UX designers, and the wider blockchain community. We aim to provide a seamless and efficient platform for these developers and designers to build their projects on, while also catering to the needs of end-users who are looking for faster, more secure and scalable solutions within the EOS ecosystem. Additionally, we are keen on attracting existing dApp user bases that would benefit from our platform's high-throughput, low-cost, and secure environment.
